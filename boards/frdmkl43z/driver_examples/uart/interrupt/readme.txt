Overview
========
The uart_functioncal_interrupt example shows how to use uart driver functional
API to receive data with interrupt method:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.70.1
- Keil MDK 5.20
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO 5.5.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL43Z board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J1_6
- TX of USB2COM to J2-4
- GND of USB2COM to J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the PC host and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
